Online voting with a Decentralized system

Decentralized system ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections

* Blockchain features make it highly secure, preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of votes
* Every transaction (vote) is recorded on the blockchain and can be publicly verified, enhancing the transparency of the election process
* Once a vote is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the election results
* lockchain can ensure voter anonymity while still verifying that each vote is legitimate, protecting voter privacy
* Without a central authority, the system is less susceptible to corruption and centralized points of failure

India uses the "first past the post"  system for its elections. In this system, voters in each constituency cast their ballots for their preferred candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the seat. This method is used for both the national elections for the Lok Sabha and the state legislative assembly elections. While the FPTP system is straightforward and easy to understand, it has notable disadvantages. It can lead to disproportional representation, where a party can win a significant majority of seats without a corresponding majority of votes. This system can also marginalize smaller parties and regional voices, encourage tactical voting, and lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among voters who support less popular candidates.

these are some of the reasons for which voting via decentralized system is better than current voting system 

### Voting using meta mask for anonymity

* Decentralization: Allows users to log in without relying on centralized servers, reducing data breaches and enhancing control over personal information.
* Security: Utilizes cryptographic keys stored on the user's device, providing higher security than traditional username/password logins.
* Privacy: No personal information required for account creation, enhancing user privacy.
* Blockchain Integration: Enables interaction with decentralized applications and transactions directly from wallets.
* User Control: Provides complete control over funds and private keys.
* Interoperability: Supports multiple blockchain networks, making it versatile for interacting with various dApps and services.
* MetaMask is available as a browser extension and a mobile app , providing a user-friendly interface for managing digital assets.
* Allows users to view their account balance, transaction history, and manage their wallets.
* Interface to send and receive cryptocurrencies, interact with smart contracts, and view pending and completed transactions
* A 12-word mnemonic phrase used to back up and restore the wallet. It is crucial for security and recovery
* Cryptographic keys generated from the seed phrase, used to sign transactions and access funds. These keys are stored locally on the user's device
